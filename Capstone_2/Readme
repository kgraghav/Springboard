# Capstone 2 Project: Modeing Traffic Flow at Mill Road (UK)

### This project aims to develop a forecasting model for traffic flow. Such a model can be used to better time traffic signa controllers, which results in reduced commute time, air and noise pollution and better living experience for people.
