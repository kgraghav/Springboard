# Capstone 3: Predicting Machinery Unbalance using Vibration Data
## How can vibration data be used to predict possible damage to rotating  shaft and machinery?

## Overview
In this project, we explore various ML modeling options to determine the feasibility of predicting rotor unbalance. We develop a custom metric. The salient features of this project are:
<li> Process for data extraction, exploration and processing with the goal of making predictive models for rotor unbalance 
<li> Training and performance of the models 
<li> Comparison of the models â€“ Evaluation on test data
