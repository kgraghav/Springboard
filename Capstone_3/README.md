# Capstone 3: Predicting Machinery Unbalance using Vibration Data
## How can vibration data be used to predict possible damage to rotating  shaft and machinery?

## Overview
In this project, we explore various ML modeling options to determine the feasibility of predicting rotor unbalance. We develop a custom metric. The salient features of this project are:
•	Process for data extraction, exploration and processing with the goal of making predictive models for rotor unbalance 
•	Training and performance of the models 
•	Comparison of the models – development time and evaluation on test data
